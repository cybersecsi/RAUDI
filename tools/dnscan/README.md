# dnscan

## Official Documentation
Reference: https://github.com/rbsec/dnscan

## Description

**dnscan** is a python wordlist-based DNS subdomain scanner.

The script will first try to perform a zone transfer using each of the target domain's nameservers.

If this fails, it will lookup TXT and MX records for the domain, and then perform a recursive subdomain scan using the supplied wordlist.

## Usage
```
docker run -it --rm secsi/dnscan -d <target_url> -w subdomains-10000.txt -t 10 -R 1.0.0.1
```

## üê≥ RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.
