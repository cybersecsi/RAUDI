# Arjun

## Official Documentation
Reference: https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun

## Description
Arjun can find query parameters for URL endpoints. If you don't get what that means, it's okay, read along.

Web applications use parameters (or queries) to accept user input, take the following example into consideration

`http://api.example.com/v1/userinfo?id=751634589`

This URL seems to load user information for a specific user id, but what if there exists a parameter named `admin` which when set to `True` makes the endpoint provide more information about the user?\
This is what Arjun does, it finds valid HTTP parameters with a huge default dictionary of 10,985 parameter names.

The best part? It takes less than 10 seconds to go through this huge list while making just 20-30 requests to the target.

## Usage
Here is the command to run **Arjun** on a URL:
```
docker run -it --rm secsi/arjun --help
```

## 🐳 RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.
