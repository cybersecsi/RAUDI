# Hydra

## Description

Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password security study shows.

There are already several login hacker tools available, however, none does either support more than one protocol to attack or support parallelized connects.

It was tested to compile cleanly on Linux, Windows/Cygwin, Solaris, FreeBSD/OpenBSD, QNX (Blackberry 10) and MacOS.

Currently this tool supports the following protocols:

 Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP,
 HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY,
 HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST,
 HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener,
 Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin,
 Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5,
 SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth,
 VNC and XMPP.

However the module engine for new services is very easy so it won't take a long time until even more services are supported.

## Usage

Attempt to login as the root user (-l root) using a password list with 6 threadson the given SSH server:

```
docker run -it --rm -v <wordlist_src_dir>:<wordlist_inner_dir> secsi/hydra -l root -P <wordlist_file> -t <num_threads> ssh://<url>
```

## üê≥ RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.

If you want to contribute, give us a star or take a quick look at the source code of **RAUDI** click [here](https://github.com/cybersecsi/RAUDI).
