# WafW00f

## Official Documentation
Reference: https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f

## Description
To do its magic, WAFW00F does the following:

- Sends a _normal_ HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a number of WAF solutions.
- If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious) HTTP requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.
- If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security solution is actively responding to our attacks.

## Usage
```
docker run -it --rm secsi/wafw00f
```

## 🐳 RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.

If you want to contribute, give us a star or take a quick look at the source code of **RAUDI** click [here](https://github.com/cybersecsi/RAUDI).
