# JWT Tool

## Description

jwt_tool.py is a toolkit for validating, forging, scanning and tampering JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).

## Usage

The first argument should be the JWT itself (unless providing this in a header or cookie value). Providing no additional arguments will show you the decoded token values for review.

## üê≥ RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.

If you want to contribute, give us a star or take a quick look at the source code of **RAUDI** click [here](https://github.com/cybersecsi/RAUDI).
