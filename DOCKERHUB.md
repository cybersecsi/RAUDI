# üê≥ HOUDINI: Hacking Offensive Updated Docker Images for Network Intrusion

Hello, friend. That's the right page, you are not mistaken. This Docker Image has been created by HOUDINI. What is HOUDINI?

**HOUDINI** (Hacking Offensive Updated Docker Images for Network Intrusion) automatically generates *Docker Images* for Network Security-related tools that are not provided by the developers. The Images are automatically updated through the GitHub Actions.

## What is HOUDINI
**HOUDINI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.

## Available Tools
This is the current list of tools that have been added. Those are all tools that do not have an official Docker Image provided by the developer:

## General Usage
For **every** image created by HOUDINI you may use it with the following syntax:
```
docker run -it --rm secsi/<tool> <command>
```

For some tools (like dirb, fuff and so on) you may need to mount a folder with all your wordlists or other assets (we do not provide the assets inside the containers to have lightweight images). Here is an example with *dirb*:
```
docker run -it --rm -v <wordlist_src_dir>:<wordlist_container_dir> secsi/dirb <url> <wordlist_container_dir>/<wordlist_file>
```

## Contributions
Everyone is invited to contribute!
If you are a user of the tool and have a suggestion for a new feature or a bug to report, please do so through the issue tracker.
